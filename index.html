    <h1>BUDGIES</h1>
    <p>Budgies, also known as the common parakeet or shell parakeet, is a small,<br>
        long-tailed, seed-eating parrot usually nicknamed the budgieor in American <br>
        English, the parakeet. Budgies are the only species in the genus Melopsittacus. <br>
         Naturally, the species is green and yellow with black, scalloped markings <br>
         on the nape,back, and wings. Budgies are bred in captivity with colouring <br> 
         of blues, whites, yellows, greys,  and even with small crests. Juveniles <br>
         and chicks are monomorphic, while adults are told apart by their cere colouring, <br>
         and their behaviour.</p>
